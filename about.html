            <h3>The Beginning</h3>
            <p>Discovering how much of an impact technology has on society was a transformative experience for me. I
                used to take for granted the role that technology plays in our lives, from the smartphones we use to the
                internet that connects us all. However, as I delved deeper into the subject, I started to realize just
                how much of an impact technology has on our society. From the way we work and communicate to how we
                entertain ourselves and stay informed, technology has transformed virtually every aspect of our daily
                lives. Furthermore, as technology continues to advance at a rapid pace, it is increasingly important to
                understand its impact on society and to consider the ethical and social implications of these
                advancements.</p>

            <h3>Why I Chose the Tech Industry</h3>
            <p>Technology has made it easier for people to access health-related information, which can help them live
                better and healthier lives. With the rise of health-related mobile applications and wearables, people
                can now monitor their physical activity, track their calorie intake, and receive personalized health
                recommendations. These technologies not only encourage people to live healthier lifestyles but also
                provide them with the tools and resources to do so. It has brought communities together and encouraged
                society to live better and healthier lives. It has created a platform for people to connect with each
                other, access health-related information and services, and participate in community activities. As
                technology continues to advance, it is crucial to ensure that everyone has access to these technologies
                to promote inclusivity and equity in our society.

                        The tech industry is on the rise and the possibilities are endless! The future is filled with
                        exciting new
                        advancements and innovations that will shape the way we live, interact, and connect with one
                        another. Being
                        a part of this revolution is essential, as the impact of technology on our lives will be
                        profound and
                        long-lasting. Together, as a society, we are pushing the limits of what is possible and reaching
                        for the
                        stars.

                        now a
                        reality. From holographic keyboards and touchscreen tables to flying cars, the tech industry is
                        making our
                        wildest dreams come true. Advances in machine learning, such as self-driving cars, virtual
                        personal
                        assistants, and even robotic surgeries, are changing the way we live and work for the better.
                        With each new
                        breakthrough, we are forging a brighter future and the possibilities are truly endless.

                        The driving force behind these advancements are the pioneers of the tech industry like Geoff
                        Hinton, Yoshua
                        Bengio, Yann LeCun, and Jurgen Schmidhuber, who never lost faith in neural networks despite
                        opposition from
                        their peers in the 1990s and 2000s. These innovators are a shining example of what can be
                        achieved with
                        determination and a strong vision.
