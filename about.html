            <h3>The Beginning</h3>
            <p>Discovering how much of an impact technology has on society was a transformative experience for me. I
                used to take for granted the role that technology plays in our lives, from the smartphones we use to the
                internet that connects us all. However, as I delved deeper into the subject, I started to realize just
                how much of an impact technology has on our society. From the way we work and communicate to how we
                entertain ourselves and stay informed, technology has transformed virtually every aspect of our daily
                lives. Furthermore, as technology continues to advance at a rapid pace, it is increasingly important to
                understand its impact on society and to consider the ethical and social implications of these
                advancements.</p>

            <h3>Why I Chose the Tech Industry</h3>
            <p>Technology has made it easier for people to access health-related information, which can help them live
                better and healthier lives. With the rise of health-related mobile applications and wearables, people
                can now monitor their physical activity, track their calorie intake, and receive personalized health
                recommendations. These technologies not only encourage people to live healthier lifestyles but also
                provide them with the tools and resources to do so. It has brought communities together and encouraged
                society to live better and healthier lives. It has created a platform for people to connect with each
                other, access health-related information and services, and participate in community activities. As
                technology continues to advance, it is crucial to ensure that everyone has access to these technologies
                to promote inclusivity and equity in our society.

Coming from next to no experience she has become an excellent and skilled developer. Her best works are found on her personal portfolio site which coincidentally is her most forward facing and impressive project in my opinion. She is hard working and, as clearly described by her projects, very self determined and capable of learning new technologies on the fly no matter what the obstacle.

What really stood out to me was her leadership capabilities as she'd always be the one to take initiative and come up with new ideas through the toughest times. I am also intrigued by her ability to learn relevant skills, whether it be building a business or even technical skills. I can assure you that her leadership, dedication, and drive is truly an asset for any team to have."</p>

If you want to keep up with her, then you better not slack off or you will get left in a cloud of dust!

                        I have seen some really impressive projects from Tina and love playing her minesweeper game! She definitely spends the time to learn about the subject matter and then does an excellent job applying the learnings she gets from her research.

                        exciting new

                        profound and
                        long-lasting. Together, as a society, we are pushing the limits of what is possible and reaching

                        assistants, and even robotic surgeries, are changing the way we live and work for the better.
                        With each new
                        breakthrough, we are forging a brighter future and the possibilities are truly endless.

                        Bengio, Yann LeCun, and Jurgen Schmidhuber, who never lost faith in neural networks despite

                        their peers in the 1990s and 2000s. These innovators are a shining example of what can be
