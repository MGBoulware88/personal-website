                <h2>The Beginning</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Realizing the immense influence technology has on our world was a paradigm-shifting moment for me.
                Previously, I had taken for granted the role technology played in our daily lives, from the devices we
                use to the networks that bind us. However, upon further exploration, I came to comprehend the depth and
                breadth of technology's impact on society. It has revolutionized how we interact, learn, work, and play,
                permeating every facet of our existence. As technology progresses at breakneck speed, it is critical to
                comprehend the societal ramifications of these advancements and reflect on the ethical and social
                responsibilities that accompany them.</p>
            <div class="section-title">

                <h2>Why I Chose the Tech Industry</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Technology has revolutionized the way we approach health and wellness, empowering individuals to take
                control of their own physical and mental well-being like never before. From cutting-edge health apps to
                wearable devices, technology has given us the ability to track and monitor our fitness levels, manage
                our diets, and receive customized health recommendations. With this newfound knowledge, we are better
                equipped to live healthier, more active lives, and to make informed decisions about our health.
                Moreover, technology has brought communities together, creating platforms for individuals to connect and
                participate in group activities and social support networks. As we continue to innovate and push the
                boundaries of what is possible, it is imperative that we ensure that everyone has access to these
                powerful tools, promoting inclusivity and equality in our society.

                            <p>Starting in middle school, I began volunteering at a Gifted Students Academy at UCI,
                                where I discovered my passion for mentoring and teaching. While in high school, I
                                focused on teaching biology and chemistry, but after graduation, I decided to shift my
                                focus to teaching coding, engineering, and robotics. I taught students of all ages, from
                                elementary to high school, for several years, and I found joy in every moment of it.
                                Being able to share my knowledge and passion for these subjects with the younger
                                generation was incredibly fulfilling, and I look forward to continuing to inspire and
                                mentor others in the future.</p>

                            <p>The value of a piece of paper lies not in its physical form, but in the skills and
                                knowledge that were acquired in the process of earning it. The effort, time, and
                                resources invested in completing projects or working with challenging colleagues do not
                                determine the worth of the paper. Instead, it is the lessons learned from these

                                experience, whether good or bad, contributes to personal and professional growth, and
                                prepares one for future challenges. It is important to embrace all experiences as they

                            One of the things that impressed me the most was Tina's ability to learn new and relevant
                            skills, whether it was in building a business or developing technical expertise. Her
                            dedication and drive to continuously improve herself and her team was truly inspiring.
                            <br><br>
                            I can say with confidence that Tina's leadership qualities and work ethic are an invaluable
                            asset for any team. Her ability to inspire and motivate those around her is truly
                            remarkable, and she has a talent for bringing out the best in everyone.

                        <p>I worked with Tina at BrainStorm Education and discovered that she is a dedicated, ambitious,
                            and hard-working person. While we did not work on the same team, her effort and the quality
                            of her work was clear where our areas overlapped.</p>

                        <p>Tina is such a delight to work with. She is both patient and driven, so she is
                            able to solve hard problems while not getting frustrated at the little mistakes
                            we make along the way. Working with Tina has allowed me to learn so much more
                            than I would have on my own or with a different pair programming partner. She is
                            also very good at bringing out the best in you. If you want to keep up with her,
                            then you better not slack off or you will get left in a cloud of dust!
                            <br><br>
                            I have seen some really impressive projects from Tina and love playing her
                            minesweeper game! She definitely spends the time to learn about the subject
                            matter and then does an excellent job applying the learnings she gets from her
                            research. Tina's potential is uncapped and she is going to do amazing things as
                            a software engineer for whoever is lucky enough to hire her.

                The impetus behind these breakthroughs originates from the trailblazers of the technology industry, including Geoff Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, Yann LeCun, and Jurgen Schmidhuber. Despite facing resistance from their contemporaries in the 1990s and 2000s, these pioneers never lost faith in neural networks. They serve as a brilliant model of what can be accomplished with perseverance and a resolute vision.
