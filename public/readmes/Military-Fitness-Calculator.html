<h3 id="army-physical-fitness-test">Army physical fitness test</h3>
<p>It is obligatory for US Army service members to go through the fitness test twice a year. It is designed so that soldiers can prove their muscular strength, endurance, and cardiovascular respiratory fitness. Since 1980, there are three disciplines, described in the <a href="http://www.armyprt.com/downloads/fm-7-22-army-physical-readiness-training.shtml">Army Field Manual 7-22</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 minutes of push-ups - a correctly performed push-up means bending the elbows and lowering the entire body as a single unit until the upper arms are at least parallel to the ground and return to the starting position by raising the entire body until the arms are fully extended. The body must remain rigid in a straight line and move as a unit while performing each repetition.</li>
<li>2 minutes of sit-ups - a correctly performed sit-up should start with the knees bent at a 45-degree angle, and then raising the upper body forward to, or beyond, the vertical position (where the neck is above the base of the spine). After reaching or surpassing the vertical position, the torso should be lowered until the bottom of the shoulder blades touch the ground.</li>
<li>A 2-mile run - should be finished in the shortest time possible. Although walking is authorized, it is strongly discouraged. It is not permitted to use any help, or even touch other participants.</li>
</ul>
<p>Army physical fitness test score is calculated by assigning a number of points to doing sit-ups, push-ups, and the time in which you do a 2-mile run. The maximum APFT score is 100 points per discipline, which gives a total of 300 points.
To pass the test, it is required to get at least 60 points (60%) in each category. This means that the minimum total score is 180 points. The APFT calculator shows the overall score in the last field.
The US Army service members are also obliged to meet body fat standards which take height, neck, waist, and hip measurements into consideration.</p>
<p>Body fat standards for the army are calculated as follows:
Men:</p>
<pre><code>BF = (<span class="hljs-number">86.010</span> * log10( waist – neck ) ) – [70.041 * log10(<span class="hljs-name">height</span>)) + <span class="hljs-number">36.76</span>
</code></pre><p>Women:</p>
<pre><code>BF = (<span class="hljs-number">163.205</span> * log10( waist + hip – neck ) ) – (<span class="hljs-number">97.684</span> * log10(height)) – <span class="hljs-number">78.387</span>
</code></pre><p>The US Army body fat percentage standards for military service personnel on active duty are described in Regulation 600-9:</p>
<ul>
<li>Age 17 to 20 - 20% for males, 30% for females;</li>
<li>Age 28 to 39 - 24% for males, 34% for females;</li>
<li>Age 21 to 27 - 22% for males, 32% for females;</li>
<li>Age over 40 - 26% for males, 36% for females.</li>
</ul>

<p>The air force physical fitness test consists of four main parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Body composition</li>
<li>Aerobic composition - 1.5 mile run or 2 km walk</li>
<li>Sit-ups in 1 minute</li>
<li>Push-ups in 1 minute</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="navy-physical-test">Navy physical test</h3>
<p>The requires physical readiness categories are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>forearm planks</li>
<li>push-ups</li>
<li>cardiovasular exercise of your choice<ul>
<li>1.5 mile run</li>
<li>450 meter run</li>
<li>500 yard swim</li>
<li>2 kilometer row</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: The youngext allowed in the Navy physical test score is <strong>17 years old</strong></p>
<p>The Navy PRT test <em>underwent some drastic modifications</em> after the break caused by the COVID pandemic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximum age limits were raised for both women and men, reaching 65+ years old for both genders</li>
<li>Forarm planks replaced curl-ups</li>
<li>There are now four cardio options instead of the previous two</li>
<li>Performance results were slightly changed in all the disciplines</li>
</ul>
<p>Body fat standards for the navy are calculated as follows:
Men:</p>
<pre><code>BF = <span class="hljs-number">495</span> / ( <span class="hljs-number">1.0324</span> - <span class="hljs-number">0.19077</span> * log10( waist - neck ) + <span class="hljs-number">0.15456</span> * log10( height ) ) - <span class="hljs-number">450</span>

<pre><code>BF = <span class="hljs-number">495</span> / ( <span class="hljs-number">1.29579</span> - <span class="hljs-number">0.35004</span> * log10( waist + hip - neck ) + <span class="hljs-number">0.22100</span> * log10( height ) ) - <span class="hljs-number">450</span>
