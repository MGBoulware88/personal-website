<p><strong>BMI formula</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>US units: BMI = (weight (lb) / height^2 (in)) * 703</li>
<li>Metric units: BMI = weight (kg) / height^2 (m)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong>:</p>
<p>Weight 64 kg and height 1.9 meters tall</p>
<p>BMI = w / h^2</p>
<p>BMI = 64 / 1.9^2</p>
<p>BMI = 64 / 3.61</p>
<p>BMI = 17.1</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong>:</p>
<p>Weight 184 lb and height 5.10 feet</p>
<p>BMI = (w / h^2) * 703</p>
<p>BMI (184 / 4900) * 703</p>
<p>BMI = 0.3755 * 703</p>
<p>BMI = 26.4</p>
<p><strong>BMI categories are as follows</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Severely underweight: less than 16.0</li>
<li>Underweight: between 16.0 and 18.4</li>
<li>Normal: between 18.5 and 24.9</li>
<li>Overweight: between 25.0 and 29.9</li>
<li>Moderately Obese: between 30.0 and 34.9</li>
<li>Severely Obese: between 35.0 and 39.9</li>
<li>Morbidly Obese: greater than 40.0</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note</em>: Keep in mind that BMI is a ratio between height and total body weight and does not differentiate between weight from muscle or weight from fat, nor consider an individual&#39;s body frame type. It is only <em>one of the several tools</em> used to assess a person&#39;s weight and overall health.</p>
<p>The following program uses the two following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>calculateBMI()</code></li>
<li><code>indexBMI()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Within <code>calculateBMI()</code>, the following is executed:</p>
<ul>
<li>the user weight is converted to kg</li>
<li>the user height is converted to centimeters</li>
<li>BMI is calculated and rounded</li>
<li><code>indexBMI()</code> is called</li>
</ul>
<p>Within <code>indexBMI()</code>, the following is executed:</p>
<ul>
<li>the final result is displayed depending on the BMI value</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are concerned about your weight, it is best to consult with a healthcare professional.</strong></p>
