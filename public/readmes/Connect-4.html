<p>Connect Four is also known as Four Up, Plot Four, Four in a Row, and Drop Four. It is a two-player connection board game, where each player takes turns dropping their respective colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The objective of the game is to be the first one to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four in one&#39;s disc colors.</p>

<p>Through alternating between the two players, we also need to be tracking when there is a possible <code>win</code> being made within the game in order to stop the program. At the end of the game, we can decide whether we want to implement a restart button or simply have the program close.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-allowing-players-to-make-moves">Step 3: Allowing players to make moves</h3>
<p>Since not all moves are valid within the game, there has to be a method of making sure each player is playing by the rules. This also means making sure the program doesn&#39;t mistakenly replaces one player&#39;s pieces for another.</p>
